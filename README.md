Export Excel table data to JIRA markup

This is an Excel file containing a macro. You can type your table into the Excel worksheet and select the macro OutputJIRA or OutputJIRAEnglish.

The macro was originally created for exporting table data that was pasted from MS Project Japanese version into Excel. Hence the macros are divided as follows.
- OutputJIRA does a straight export of the data.
- OutputJIRAEnglish translated MS Project headings and Japanese day names to English, then exports.

Of course you can use this to export any Excel data, it does not have to be MS Project date. If it is not MS Project data, OutputJIRA and OutputJIRAEnglish do the same thing, i.e. simply export!
